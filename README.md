Eligos, a static code analysis tool for the [_Kotlin_ programming language](https://kotlinlang.org/).

#### Support Code Smells

In the current version, we can detect the following 11 code smell:

### Quick Start ...

1. Clone  this Repo
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TnoAlex/Eligos.git
```
2. Prepare the environment
   Gradle 6.8.3+ is the minimum requirement. However, the recommended versions together with the other tools recommended
   versions are:

| Gradle | Kotlin   | Java Target Level | JDK Min Version |
|--------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| `8.0+` | `1.9.10` | `17`              | `17`            |
3. Compiler & Build
```bash
    ./gradlew build #on linux 
    ./gradlew.bat build #on windows
```
4. Find the libs
	You can find the executable cli jar at `eligos-cli/build/libs` and Installable plugin at `eligos-plugin/build/distributions`. 

### From Docker

1. Clone this Repo

   ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/TnoAlex/Eligos.git
   ```

2. Build Docker Image

   ```bash
   	docker build -t eligos:1.0 .
   ```

3. Run Eligos by docker

   ```bash
   	docker run -v $PROJECT:/dist/project -v $RESULT:/dist/result eligos:1.0 kotlin ./project ./result --with java
   ```

   In the above command, `$PRJECT` refers to the local location of the item to be analyzed, `$RESULT` the location where the local results are storedÔºå**Make sure they are all present before using this command**. The two folders located after the Kotlin parameter are the internal Docker mappings, which are fixed.

### Arguments & Options

The CLI tool usage could be listed by `eligos --help`, like following:

```text

  -D, --debug                Out put exception stack
  -Nr, --no-report           Disable reporter (debug only)
  -h, --help                 Show this message and exit

Arguments:
  <major language>      The major language to be analyzed
  <source path>         The path of source files
  <result output path>  The path to out put result
```

If yob use Third-party libraries, or use build tools like `Maven` or `Gradlle`, please set the correct `classpath` so that the tool can find these dependencies and avoid the problem that some external dependencies cannot be resolved. 

### How to add more rules

We provide a simple mechanism to extend eligos. The following steps allow you to create a rule that belongs to you: 

1. Create a Psi file processor which implement `PsiProcessor`, and define a issue which is extend `Issue` 

2. Add an Psi file listener with `@EventListener` annotation and report the issue like this:

   ```kotlin
   class MyProcessor : PsiProcessor{
       @EventLinster
       fun process(ktFile:PsiFile){
           //do someting
           context.reportIssue(MyIssue(hashSetOf(ktFile.virtualFilePath)))
       }
   }
   class MyIssue(affectedFiles:HashSet<String>) : Issue(AnalysisHierarchyEnum.FILE, affectedFiles, "My Issue", null)
   ```

3. Make your rule can scaned by the Component Manager with `@Component` annotation like this

   ```kotlin
   @Component
   class MyProcessor : PsiProcessor{
       @EventLinster
       fun process(ktFile:PsiFile){
           //do someting
       }
   }
   ```

4. If you want this rule only run on plugin, please use `@Suitable` annotation

   ```kotlin
   @Component
   @Suitable(LaunchEnvironment.IDE_PLUGIN)
   class MyProcessor : PsiProcessor{
       @EventLinster
       fun process(ktFile:PsiFile){
           //do someting
       }
   }
   ```

   

5. That's Allüòù. If you want to customize Eligos in more detail, please refer to the [Eligos Architecture Diagram](./doc/architecture.md) , [Execution Process](./doc/execution_process.md).
